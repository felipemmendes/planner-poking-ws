# Planner Poking (Server)

Planner Poking is a play on the words from the technique "Planning Poker", commonly used for estimating tasks for Scrum or other Agile frameworks.

With this app, you and your team can:
- create rooms with ease
- use custom values for cards
- see who is voting (or keep it anonymous with custom usernames)

In a room, all actions occur in real time with no need to create accounts or worry about saved data (nothing is saved!).

You can check the code for the client in the [Planner Poking (Client) repo](https://github.com/felipemmendes/planner-poking-vue).

I used this project to learn and apply [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) with a WebSocket connection.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Run the server

```sh
npm run start
```
